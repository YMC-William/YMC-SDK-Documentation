# YMC C++ SDK 

![Mou icon](http://developer.ymcgames.com/images/ymc-logo.png)

## Overview

**YMC SDK** offers mobile game developers the chance to access the YMC User system as well as Analytics information.


For **Cocos2D-x** and other **C++** games, we deliver header files & libraries for both iOS & Android platforms, and they can be used immediately to utilize what's offered by the YMC User and Analytics systems. 


## Get Started
The C++ SDK is available on the YMC Developer site [https://developer.ymcgames.com](). Choose the binaries according to your target platforms (Android / iOS).


## What's inside the SDK
The SDK header files and libraries is organized as follows:


	include/
		YMCU.h
		YMCA.h
		...
	lib/	
		ymcsdk.a
		...

and they should be put into your game project and accessed accordingly.

## YMCU

To use YMC User system, please use the APIs declared in the header file YMCU.h:


	#include "YMCU.h"
	
### Initialization

Please call the following API to initialize things first:


	YMCResult YMCUserInit(YMCUserOptions* ymcUserOptions);
	
where the *YMCUserOptions* is declared as:

*YMCUserOptions* ï¼š

    typedef struct  {
        char game_id[MAX_GAME_ID_LENGTH];
        int use_test_server;  // 0 <- use live server, 1 <- use test server
    }YMCUserOptions;
	
Example:


    YMCUserOptions userOptions;
    strcpy(userOptions.game_id, YOUR_GAMEID);
    userOptions.use_test_server = 1;
    YMCUserInit( &userOptions );
    	
### Register a YMC account:


This API is for user account registration:
  
	YMCResult YMCUserRegister(eMail, password, username,NULL,NULL, NULL,
                          (YMCUOnSuccess)OnSuccess,
                          (YMCUOnError)OnError);
                          
Most YMCU APIs are implemented as asynchronous calls, and the following function points should be supplied as callback parameters:

    void OnError(char* error_response, void* pdata);
    void OnSuccess(YMCUserSession *puserSession, void *pdata)

Example:


    void OnError(char* error_response, void* pdata)
    {
    	CCLOG("Error! ");
    	CCLOG("%s", error_response);
        //...
    }

    void OnSuccess(YMCUserSession *puserSession, void *pdata)
    {
    	CCLOG("Success! ");
    	CCLOG("access_token: %s", puserSession->access_token);
    	CCLOG("user_id: %d",puserSession->user_id);
    	CCLOG("expires: %d",puserSession->expires);
    
    	//...
    }

    YMCResult result;
    result = YMCUserRegister(eMail, password, username,NULL,NULL, NULL,
                          (YMCUOnSuccess)OnSuccess,
                          (YMCUOnError)OnError);
                         
### Login:

As with Registration, this should only be used for an existing account:


	YMCResult result;
	result = YMCUserLogin(eMail, password, username, NULL,
                          (YMCUOnSuccess)OnSuccess,
                          (YMCUOnError)OnError);
        CCLOG("Login Result: %d",result);
    

### Logoff:

	YMCResult result;
    result = YMCUserLogout(&currentSession, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    CCLOG("Logoff Result: %d",result);
    
### Retrieve Profile of current user:
YMC User Account is described by the following Struct:

    typedef struct {
        char user_name[MAX_USER_NAME_LENGTH];
        char email[MAX_EMAIL_LENGTH];
        char first_name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
        char last_name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
        char gender[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
        char gamesJSON[MAX_JSON_STRING];
    } YMCUser;
    
To retrieve the user details in current Session:    

	YMCResult YMCUserGetInfo(YMCUserSession* userSession,
                            void* pdata,
                            YMCUOnSuccessUserInfo OnSuccess,
                            YMCUOnError OnError);
where the "OnSuccess" callback function pointer is declared as:

	typedef void (*YMCUOnSuccessUserInfo)(YMCUser* puser, void* pdata);
                           
### Ask for resending password to my Email:

This API is used to help the users when they forgot their password:

	YMCResult YMCUserPasswordForgot(const char* email,
                                    void* pdata,
                                    YMCUOnSuccessForgot OnSuccessForgot,
                                    YMCUOnError OnError);
     

## YMCA

To use the YMC Analytics service, please use the APIs declared in the header file YMCA.h:

	#include "YMCA.h"

### Initialization
Please call yaInit to initialize with your Game's YMC ID:

	yaInit(YOUR_GAMEID);

### Tracking Purchases
yaCharge should be called to track any purchases made by the player.

    void yaCharge(const char *currency, double value);
    
Example:

     yaCharge("USD",6.99);
     yaCharge("RMB",35);


### yaEvent
Events describe things that happen in your game, usually as the result of a user action; for example, when a player conquers a level, or purchased some equipment, you can send an event to record the incident.
	
### Track custom events
Sometimes you might want to track other specific things that happened in your game, such as when the player passed a level, and YMCA allows developers construct a  customized yaEvent for such purposes: 

    yaEvent *yaEventCreate(const char *name);

    void yaAddNumber(yaEvent *event,const char*key,double value);

    void yaAddString(yaEvent *event,const char *key, const char *value); 

and track the custom event with:
    
    void yaTrack(yaEvent *event);		

Example:

	yaEvent *evt = yaEventCreate("Level_Up");
	yaAddString(evt, "Beat", "Playerx");
	yaAddNumber(evt, "Level", 10);
	yaTrack(evt);
